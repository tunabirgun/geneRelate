Might be involved in the regulated assembly of V1 subunits onto the membrane sector or alternatively may prevent the passage of protons through V0 pores; Belongs to the V-ATPase V0D/AC39 subunit family."},"A0A0D2Y973":{"name":"FOXG_12843","size":"593","annotation":"Nop domain-containing protein."},"A0A0D2Y974":{"name":"FOXG_12844","size":"341","annotation":"PHB domain-containing protein."},"A0A0D2Y975":{"name":"FOXG_12845","size":"569","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A0D2Y976":{"name":"FOXG_12846","size":"700","annotation":"Iron-sulfur clusters transporter ATM1, mitochondrial."},"A0A0D2Y977":{"name":"FOXG_12847","size":"427","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A0D2Y978":{"name":"FOXG_12848","size":"1829","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A0D2Y979":{"name":"FOXG_12849","size":"671","annotation":"Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type domain-containing protein."},"A0A0D2Y980":{"name":"FOXG_12850","size":"397","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A0D2Y981":{"name":"A0A0D2Y981","size":"232","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A0D2Y982":{"name":"A0A0D2Y982","size":"484","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A0D2Y983":{"name":"FOXG_12853","size":"505","annotation":"MFS domain-containing protein."},"A0A0D2Y984":{"name":"FOXG_12854","size":"349","annotation":"PKS_ER domain-containing protein."},"A0A0D2Y985":{"name":"A0A0D2Y985","size":"308","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A0D2Y986":{"name":"FOXG_12856","size":"514","annotation":"MFS domain-containing protein; Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.

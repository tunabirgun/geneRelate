Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors."},"A0A428TTX4":{"name":"CEP52_006260","size":"416","annotation":"Protein kinase domain-containing protein; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily."},"A0A428TTX5":{"name":"CEP52_006269","size":"728","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428TTX6":{"name":"CEP52_006223","size":"330","annotation":"Dol-P-Glc:Glc(2)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase."},"A0A428TTX7":{"name":"CEP52_006219","size":"512","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family."},"A0A428TTX8":{"name":"CEP52_006217","size":"607","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428TTX9":{"name":"CEP52_006273","size":"268","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428TTY0":{"name":"CEP52_006205","size":"296","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Belongs to the STXBP/unc-18/SEC1 family."},"A0A428TTY2":{"name":"CEP52_006266","size":"1469","annotation":"DH domain-containing protein."},"A0A428TTY3":{"name":"CEP52_006204","size":"434","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Belongs to the STXBP/unc-18/SEC1 family."},"A0A428TTY4":{"name":"CEP52_006286","size":"601","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428TTY5":{"name":"CEP52_006220","size":"218","annotation":"Abhydrolase_3 domain-containing protein."},"A0A428TTY6":{"name":"CEP52_006207","size":"381","annotation":"F-box domain-containing protein."},"A0A428TTY7":{"name":"CEP52_006270","size":"218","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428TTY8":{"name":"CEP52_006226","size":"640","annotation":"Transmembrane 9 superfamily member; Belongs to the nonaspanin (TM9SF) (TC 9.A.2) family."},"A0A428TTY9":{"name":"CEP52_006231","size":"465","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428TTZ0":{"name":"CEP52_006215","size":"295","annotation":"CFEM domain-containing protein."},"A0A428TTZ2":{"name":"CEP52_006208","size":"406","annotation":"Oxidored_FMN domain-containing protein."},"A0A428TTZ3":{"name":"CEP52_006289","size":"182","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428TTZ4":{"name":"CEP52_006227","size":"368","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428TTZ5":{"name":"CEP52_006241","size":"364","annotation":"D-amino-acid oxidase."},"A0A428TTZ6":{"name":"CEP52_006235","size":"502","annotation":"Sensitive to high expression protein 9, mitochondrial; Required for the maintenance of the structure of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

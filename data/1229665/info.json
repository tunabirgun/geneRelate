TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modificati [...] "},"N1RGQ9":{"name":"FOC4_g10013823","size":"419","annotation":"Putative peptidase yqhT."},"N1RGR0":{"name":"FOC4_g10014405","size":"606","annotation":"Putative transporter C3H1.06c."},"N1RGR1":{"name":"FOC4_g10007602","size":"90","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"N1RGR2":{"name":"FOC4_g10007869","size":"331","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"N1RGR3":{"name":"FOC4_g10014410","size":"590","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"N1RGR4":{"name":"FOC4_g10013828","size":"712","annotation":"Pentafunctional AROM polypeptide."},"N1RGR5":{"name":"FOC4_g10007372","size":"156","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"N1RGR6":{"name":"FOC4_g10007610","size":"239","annotation":"Heterokaryon incompatibility protein 6, OR allele."},"N1RGR7":{"name":"FOC4_h10017162","size":"106","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"N1RGR8":{"name":"FOC4_g10014415","size":"110","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"N1RGR9":{"name":"FOC4_g10013833","size":"310","annotation":"3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase FabG;

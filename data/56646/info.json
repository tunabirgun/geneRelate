Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling."},"A0A2L2U0U0":{"name":"A0A2L2U0U0","size":"458","annotation":"Tyrosine-protein phosphatase domain-containing protein."},"A0A2L2U0U2":{"name":"A0A2L2U0U2","size":"67","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A2L2U0U9":{"name":"A0A2L2U0U9","size":"401","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Belongs to the peptidase S8 family."},"A0A2L2U0V0":{"name":"A0A2L2U0V0","size":"85","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A2L2U0V1":{"name":"A0A2L2U0V1","size":"455","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Belongs to the class-III pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase family."},"A0A2L2U0V3":{"name":"A0A2L2U0V3","size":"456","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A2L2U0V8":{"name":"A0A2L2U0V8","size":"313","annotation":"HTH OST-type domain-containing protein."},"A0A2L2U0W2":{"name":"A0A2L2U0W2","size":"65","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A2L2U0W4":{"name":"A0A2L2U0W4","size":"871","annotation":"ANK_REP_REGION domain-containing protein."},"A0A2L2U0W6":{"name":"A0A2L2U0W6","size":"208","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A2L2U0W7":{"name":"A0A2L2U0W7","size":"348","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A2L2U0W9":{"name":"A0A2L2U0W9","size":"297","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A2L2U0X0":{"name":"A0A2L2U0X0","size":"61","annotation":"Helicase C-terminal domain-containing protein."},"A0A2L2U0X7":{"name":"A0A2L2U0X7","size":"773","annotation":"Myotubularin phosphatase domain-containing protein."},"A0A2L2U0X9":{"name":"A0A2L2U0X9","size":"437","annotation":"HEME_HALOPEROXIDASE domain-containing protein."},"A0A2L2U0Y0":{"name":"A0A2L2U0Y0","size":"1435","annotation":"Pre-mRNA-splicing factor; Involved in mRNA splicing where it associates with cdc5 and the other cwf proteins as part of the spliceosome."},"A0A2L2U0Y1":{"name":"A0A2L2U0Y1","size":"177","annotation":"Carbonic anhydrase; Reversible hydration of carbon dioxide.

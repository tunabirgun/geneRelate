TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modificati [...] "},"A0A3M2RN00":{"name":"CDV36_013784","size":"361","annotation":"FMN hydroxy acid dehydrogenase domain-containing protein."},"A0A3M2RN01":{"name":"CDV36_013690","size":"133","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A3M2RN02":{"name":"CDV36_013718","size":"205","annotation":"DUF202 domain-containing protein."},"A0A3M2RN03":{"name":"CDV36_013755","size":"328","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A3M2RN04":{"name":"CDV36_013693","size":"525","annotation":"AA_permease domain-containing protein."},"A0A3M2RN05":{"name":"CDV36_013740","size":"643","annotation":"HET domain-containing protein."},"A0A3M2RN06":{"name":"CDV36_013679","size":"515","annotation":"ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHH1; Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family."},"A0A3M2RN08":{"name":"CDV36_013847","size":"70","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A3M2RN09":{"name":"CDV36_013781","size":"243","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A3M2RN10":{"name":"CDV36_013682","size":"313","annotation":"CTP_transf_like domain-containing protein."},"A0A3M2RN11":{"name":"CDV36_013736","size":"163","annotation":"Thioredoxin domain-containing protein."},"A0A3M2RN12":{"name":"CDV36_013735","size":"402","annotation":"TLC domain-containing protein."},"A0A3M2RN13":{"name":"CDV36_013811","size":"636","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A3M2RN14":{"name":"CDV36_013689","size":"301","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A3M2RN15":{"name":"CDV36_013703","size":"357","annotation":"Nucleoporin GLE2."},"A0A3M2RN16":{"name":"CDV36_013842","size":"1135","annotation":"Amine oxidase."},"A0A3M2RN17":{"name":"CDV36_013729","size":"131","annotation":"Guanyl-specific ribonuclease F1."},"A0A3M2RN18":{"name":"CDV36_013675","size":"285","annotation":"WSC domain-containing protein."},"A0A3M2RN19":{"name":"CDV36_013715","size":"114","annotation":"Cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunit; Binds to the catalytic subunit of the cyclin dependent kinases and is essential for their biological function."},"A0A3M2RN20":{"name":"CDV36_013696","size":"1006","annotation":"Pre-mRNA-splicing factor ATP-dependent RNA helicase-like protein cdc28."},"A0A3M2RN21":{"name":"CDV36_013774","size":"354","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A3M2RN23":{"name":"CDV36_013826","size":"475","annotation":"Vacuolar calcium ion transporter; Has a role in promoting intracellular calcium ion sequestration via the exchange of calcium ions for hydrogen ions across the vacuolar membrane.

Fusaristatin A consists of a polyketide chain linked to three amino acid residues glutamine (Gln), dehydroalanine (dehydro- Ala), and beta-aminoisobutyric acid. The biosynthesis starts with formation of a linear polyketide chain by the highly reducing polyketide synthase PKS6. The gene cluster does not contain an acyl-CoA ligase or an acyl-transferase, and it is therefore predicted that the polyketide is transferred directly [...] "},"A0A098DDI5":{"name":"FG10557.1","size":"371","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDJ0":{"name":"FG08213.1","size":"373","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDJ3":{"name":"A0A098DDJ3","size":"2182","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDJ5":{"name":"A0A098DDJ5","size":"641","annotation":"AIG1-type G domain-containing protein."},"A0A098DDK0":{"name":"A0A098DDK0","size":"724","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDK1":{"name":"A0A098DDK1","size":"862","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDK5":{"name":"A0A098DDK5","size":"151","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDK7":{"name":"A0A098DDK7","size":"556","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDK9":{"name":"FG08228.1","size":"506","annotation":"FAD_binding_3 domain-containing protein."},"A0A098DDL6":{"name":"FG08235.1","size":"717","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDL9":{"name":"FG08237.1","size":"964","annotation":"HET domain-containing protein."},"A0A098DDM3":{"name":"FG10594.1","size":"198","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDM6":{"name":"A0A098DDM6","size":"558","annotation":"C2H2-type domain-containing protein."},"A0A098DDN2":{"name":"FG10607.1","size":"484","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDN3":{"name":"A0A098DDN3","size":"45","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDN4":{"name":"FG08256.1","size":"504","annotation":"MFS domain-containing protein."},"A0A098DDN5":{"name":"FG08259.1","size":"890","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDN6":{"name":"A0A098DDN6","size":"458","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDN9":{"name":"FG08262.1","size":"784","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDP3":{"name":"A0A098DDP3","size":"486","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDP7":{"name":"A0A098DDP7","size":"95","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDQ1":{"name":"A0A098DDQ1","size":"92","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDQ3":{"name":"A0A098DDQ3","size":"63","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDQ6":{"name":"FG10624.1","size":"311","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDQ8":{"name":"A0A098DDQ8","size":"716","annotation":"Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type domain-containing protein."},"A0A098DDR8":{"name":"A0A098DDR8","size":"260","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDS1":{"name":"FG10640.1","size":"427","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDS2":{"name":"FG08698.1","size":"246","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDS5":{"name":"A0A098DDS5","size":"78","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDS8":{"name":"FG10648.1","size":"1074","annotation":"CHAT domain-containing protein."},"A0A098DDT2":{"name":"A0A098DDT2","size":"303","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDT3":{"name":"A0A098DDT3","size":"2495","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Belongs to the PI3/PI4-kinase family."},"A0A098DDT6":{"name":"A0A098DDT6","size":"56","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDT8":{"name":"FG10658.1","size":"692","annotation":"HET domain-containing protein."},"A0A098DDT9":{"name":"A0A098DDT9","size":"56","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDU7":{"name":"A0A098DDU7","size":"60","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDV3":{"name":"FG08699.1","size":"308","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A098DDV4":{"name":"FG10671.1","size":"382","annotation":"3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase; Catalyzes the oxidation of 3-carboxy-2-hydroxy-4- methylpentanoate (3-isopropylmalate) to 3-carboxy-4-methyl-2- oxopentanoate.

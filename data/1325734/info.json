Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling."},"A0A428QEV0":{"name":"CEP54_005059","size":"156","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428QEV4":{"name":"CEP54_005065","size":"422","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428QEV6":{"name":"CEP54_005008","size":"208","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428QEV8":{"name":"CEP54_005085","size":"269","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A428QEW0":{"name":"CEP54_005088","size":"361","annotation":"NMO domain-containing protein."},"A0A428QEW4":{"name":"CEP54_005049","size":"896","annotation":"Sulfatase domain-containing protein."},"A0A428QEW6":{"name":"CEP54_005066","size":"990","annotation":"Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase; Catalyzes the first step of the methylation pathway of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, the SAM-dependent methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME); Belongs to the class VI-like SAM-binding methyltransferase superfamily.

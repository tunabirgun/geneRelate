Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors."},"A0A395RG02":{"name":"FSPOR_11637","size":"439","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A395RG04":{"name":"FSPOR_11621","size":"378","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A395RG05":{"name":"FSPOR_11596","size":"88","annotation":"Mitochondrial zinc maintenance protein 1, mitochondrial."},"A0A395RG06":{"name":"FSPOR_11616","size":"98","annotation":"Csbdlike domain-containing protein."},"A0A395RG07":{"name":"FSPOR_11662","size":"705","annotation":"Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type domain-containing protein."},"A0A395RG08":{"name":"FSPOR_11594","size":"381","annotation":"Sterol 24-C-methyltransferase; Catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol."},"A0A395RG10":{"name":"FSPOR_11617","size":"331","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A395RG11":{"name":"FSPOR_11600","size":"172","annotation":"C2h2 type zinc finger containing protein."},"A0A395RG12":{"name":"FSPOR_11605","size":"92","annotation":"Uncharacterized protein."},"A0A395RG13":{"name":"FSPOR_11627","size":"286","annotation":"Nadh oxidase."},"A0A395RG14":{"name":"FSPOR_11782","size":"255","annotation":"Carboxymethylenebutenolidase."},"A0A395RG16":{"name":"FSPOR_11589","size":"1705","annotation":"Lactose permease; Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
